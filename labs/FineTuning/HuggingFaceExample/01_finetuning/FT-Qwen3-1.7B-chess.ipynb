        "\n",
        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we showcase how to fine-tune the Qwen3-1.7B model on AWS Trainium using the Hugging Face Optimum Neuron library.\n",
        "The goal of this task is chess move prediction — training the model to analyze chess positions in FEN format and select the best moves.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will fine-tune the model using `optimum.neuron`, save the trained checkpoint, and then deploy it for inference with Optimum-Neuron[vllm], enabling high-performance, low-latency chess move prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end of this notebook, you'll have a fine-tuned, Trainium-optimized Qwen3 model ready for deployment and real-time inference. This workflow demonstrates how to leverage the Optimum Neuron toolchain to efficiently train and serve large language models on AWS Neuron devices.\n",
        "\n",
        "For this module, you will be using the [aicrowd/ChessExplained](https://huggingface.co/datasets/aicrowd/ChessExplained) dataset which consists of thousands of chess positions with expert analysis and move selections.\n",
        "\n",
        "## About the Dataset\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset contains chess positions in FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation) format along with:\n",
        "- Visual board representations\n",
        "- List of legal moves\n",
        "- Expert reasoning (in `<think>` tags)\n",
        "- Best move selection (in `<uci_move>` tags)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Dataset example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*Position (FEN):* `rnbq1rk1/ppp1bpp1/4pn1p/3p4/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP1B1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 7`\n",
        "\n",
        "*Legal moves:* `['g8h8', 'g8h7', 'f8e8', 'd8e8', 'c7c5', 'b7b6', 'a7a6', ...]`\n",
        "\n",
        "*Expert analysis:* \n",
        "```\n",
        "<think>\n",
        "After Pawn moves to c5, this causes Black to attacks the pawn on d4. So c5 is the most logical. Position is drawish.\n",
        "</think>\n",
        "\n",
        "<uci_move>c7c5</uci_move>\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "By fine-tuning the model over several thousand of these chess examples, the model will learn to analyze positions and generate both reasoning and optimal moves.\n",
        "\n",
        "This chess move prediction use case was selected so you can successfully fine-tune your model in a reasonably short amount of time (~25 minutes) which is appropriate for this workshop. The same techniques can be applied to more complex reasoning tasks such as strategic game playing, multi-step planning, and expert decision-making.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Install requirements\n",
        "This notebook uses [Hugging Face Optimum Neuron](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-neuron) which works like an interface between the Hugging Face Transformers library and AWS Accelerators including AWS Trainium and AWS Inferentia. We will also install some other libraries like peft, trl etc.  You may see some errors from the pip dependency resolver.  This is expected. \n"
