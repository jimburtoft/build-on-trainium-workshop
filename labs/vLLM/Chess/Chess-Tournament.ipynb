    "### Understanding the Speedup\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Process-level parallelism** (`--parallelism 4`):\n",
    "   - Tournament scheduler runs 4 games simultaneously in separate processes\n",
    "   - Each game makes HTTP requests to the vLLM server independently\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Request-level batching** (vLLM server):\n",
    "   - Server configured with `max_num_seqs=4` and `continuous_batching=true`\n",
    "   - When 4 games request moves at similar times, vLLM automatically batches them\n",
    "   - Batched requests are processed together on Neuron cores\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected results:**\n",
    "- Sequential (parallelism=1): ~0.65s per move, games run one after another\n",
    "- Parallel (parallelism=4): ~1.86s per move, but 4 games run simultaneously\n",
    "- **Throughput improvement: ~1.4x** (40% faster overall)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why not 4x speedup?**\n",
    "- Individual request latency increases due to batching overhead\n",
    "- Not all requests arrive at exactly the same time (timing variance)\n",
    "- Server batch efficiency: ~35% of theoretical maximum\n",
    "- Still significant savings: games complete much faster overall"

    "\n",
    "- Run chess tournaments with TrueSkill ratings  \n",
    "- Leveraged automatic request batching for 1.4x throughput  \n",
    "- Evaluated model strength against multiple baselines  \n",
    "- Analyzed performance with detailed metrics  \n",
    "- Understood concurrency trade-offs  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Automatic Concurrency**: Process-level parallelism (`p_map`) + vLLM continuous batching work together automatically\n",
    "2. **Optimal Parallelism**: Set `--parallelism` to match `max_num_seqs` (typically 4) for best throughput\n",
    "3. **Throughput vs Latency**: Individual requests slower, but total throughput higher\n",
    "4. **Real-world Benefit**: Tournament games complete ~40% faster with parallelism=4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fine-tune your model further based on tournament weaknesses\n",
    "- Experiment with different training datasets\n",
    "- Test against stronger opponents (Stockfish skill 15-20)\n",
    "- Deploy to production with learned configurations\n",
