    "### How It Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run multiple games in parallel (covered in Chess-Tournament.ipynb), the tournament scheduler uses Python multiprocessing to run games concurrently. Each game makes HTTP requests to the same vLLM server.\n",
    "\n",
    "**With 1 game (sequential):**\n",
    "- Latency: ~0.65s per move\n",
    "- Throughput: 1.54 moves/second\n",
    "\n",
    "**With 4 games (parallel):**\n",
    "- Latency per game: ~1.86s per move (games wait in small batches)\n",
    "- Total throughput: 2.15 moves/second across all games\n",
    "- **Improvement: 1.4x faster** (games complete ~40% faster overall)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why the improvement?**\n",
    "The vLLM server batches concurrent requests together, processing them simultaneously on the Neuron cores. This amortizes the overhead of model inference across multiple requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing Concurrency:\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll see this in action in the next notebook (Chess-Tournament.ipynb), where running with `--parallelism 4` enables automatic batching."
